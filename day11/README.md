# MLOps Landscape in 2025 and Practical Introduction

## Overview of the MLOps Landscape in 2025

The MLOps ecosystem in 2025 is a mature and diverse landscape that streamlines the machine learning lifecycle from development to production. It encompasses tools and platforms for experiment tracking, data pipelines, model deployment, monitoring, and end-to-end workflows, supporting both traditional ML and emerging LLMOps (Large Language Model Operations). Organizations leverage a mix of open-source tools for flexibility and community support, and managed cloud services for scalability and integration. Below is a high-level summary of the key MLOps categories and prominent tools in 2025, based on industry insights from sources like [Neptune.ai](https://neptune.ai/blog/mlops-tools-platforms-landscape) and [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/top-mlops-tools).

## Practical MLOps Introduction
To explore a practical implementation of MLOps, navigate to the [`medical_analysis`](./medical_analysis/) folder in this repository. It contains a complete example of an MLOps pipeline for binary classification of chest X-ray images (NORMAL vs. PNEUMONIA) using a VGG16-based CNN. The project demonstrates key MLOps practices:
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow logs parameters, metrics, models, and visualizations.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Prefect manages data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation tasks.
- **Model Serving**: FastAPI provides a REST API for inference, containerized with Docker.
- **Reproducibility**: The pipeline ensures consistent data handling and model versioning.

### Getting Started
See the detailed setup and usage instructions in the [`medical_analysis/README.md`](./medical_analysis/README.md) file. It includes steps for:
- Downloading the chest X-ray dataset via Kaggle.
- Setting up MLflow and Prefect.
- Running the training pipeline.
- Building and testing the FastAPI service with Docker.

This hands-on example illustrates how MLOps tools work together to create a reproducible, production-ready ML workflow.
